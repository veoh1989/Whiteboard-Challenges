Given a 2-dimensional array of numbers, rotate the array 90 degrees.

```js
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
]

// rotated 90 degrees
[
  [7, 4, 1],
  [8, 5, 2],
  [9, 6, 3],
]

```

Write at least four tests for this function
* your tests should cover basic (*expected*) functionality
* your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
